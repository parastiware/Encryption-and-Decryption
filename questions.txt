What is the Caesar Cipher?
A) A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
B) A cipher that uses a random key to encrypt messages.
C) A cipher that rearranges the letters of the plaintext according to a key.
D) A cipher that encrypts each letter using a different substitution alphabet.
In Caesar Cipher encryption, what is the key?
A) The encrypted message.
B) The alphabet.
C) The number of positions each letter is shifted.
D) The original plaintext.
If the Caesar Cipher has a shift of 3, what would "HELLO" encrypt to?
A) "KHOOR"
B) "HOLLE"
C) "EBIIL"
D) "HELLO"
What is the decryption process in Caesar Cipher?
A) Shifting each letter of the ciphertext to the left.
B) Shifting each letter of the ciphertext to the right.
C) Using a different key to encrypt the ciphertext.
D) Shifting each letter of the ciphertext by the same amount as the encryption but in the opposite direction.
In Caesar Cipher, if the shift is 5 and you decrypt the message "MJQQT" what is the original plaintext?
A) "HELLO"
B) "GOODBYE"
C) "ENCRYPT"
D) "MESSAGE"
What is a weakness of the Caesar Cipher?
A) It is too complex to implement.
B) It requires a computer to encrypt and decrypt messages.
C) It is vulnerable to brute-force attacks because of its small key space.
D) It can only encrypt letters and not numbers or special characters.
